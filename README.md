# Pandas Challenge

In this task I assume the role of Chief Data Scientist for my local government area. I am to assis the school board and mayor in making strategic decisions in regards to fund allocations and priorities going into the future regarding the schools in the area.

Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, I am to analyse two files, "schools_complete" and "students_complete", and create a report that forms a conclusion based on the data.

The following are the tasks I need to complete, along with key information I needed to include:
1. Local Government Area Summary - A snapshot of the area's key metrics and includes: Total number of unique schools, Total students, Total budget, Average maths score, Average reading score, % passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths), % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading), % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)
2. School Summary - A summarization of the key metrics of each school analysed, including: School name, School type, Total students, Total school budget, Per student budget, Average maths score, Average reading score, % passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths), % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading), % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)
3. Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing) - Sorting the schools based on their % overall passing metric and displaying the top 5 schools
4. Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing) - Sorting the schools based on their % overall passing metric and displaying the bottom 5 schools
5. Math Scores by Year - A list of the average mathematics scores for students in each year level in each school
6. Reading Scores by Year - A list of the average reading scores for students in each year level in each school
7. Scores by School Spending - Displaying school performance based on the average amount of overall school budget spent on each student, with the following metrics included: Average maths score, Average reading score, % passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths), % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading), % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)
8. Scores by School Size - As with "Scores by School Spending", a similar output is displayed but based on the student population of schools
9. Scores by School Type - As with the last two outputs, a similar output is displayed but based on whether the school was a government or independent school
